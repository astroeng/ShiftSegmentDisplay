#Quad Seven Segment Driver

This library can drive two quad seven segment common anode displays. It uses two 8 bit shift registers such as the 74595 to drive a pair of displays. The library is setup to allow the user fairly easy configuration for their specific application/configuration.

The library uses timer2 to control the refresh rate of the displays.
